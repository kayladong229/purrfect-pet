## Description
Purrfect Pet is an application that allows users to select a wide variety of pets in a style reminiscent of dating apps (e.g. Tinder). Users can create an account and put a search term (e.g. dog, cat) in the search bar at the top, and in turn, receive a gallery of their searched pets one photo at a time. Pets that are swiped to the right are saved to the users' Favorite Pets page, and pets that are swiped to the left are not.
